##  Overview

Over **115 million** people globally suffer from kidney stones. Early and accurate detection through imaging can prevent complications like renal failure. This project applies **deep learning (YOLOv8)** to CT scan images, aiming to automate and improve kidney stone detection using **instance segmentation** techniques.

---

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Manual identification of kidney stones in CT scans is time-consuming and prone to human error. The goal is to develop an automated tool using deep learning that ensures **high precision**, **fast diagnosis**, and **detailed localization** of kidney stones.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

* Detect and segment kidney stones from CT scans using YOLOv8.
* Build a GUI for uploading images and displaying detection results.
* Achieve high accuracy using annotated datasets and robust preprocessing.

---

## üß¨ Methodology

1. **Dataset Preparation**:

   * 2300 CT scan images collected and annotated.
   * Expanded to 5200 images using augmentation techniques.

2. **Annotation**:

   * Instance segmentation using **Roboflow**.

3. **Preprocessing**:

   * Resizing (640√ó640), de-blurring (Weiner deconvolution), and noise filtering.

4. **Training**:

   * YOLOv8 model trained using Google Colab with GPU support.
   * Evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

5. **Detection Interface**:

   * GUI created in Google Colab using `ipywidgets`.

## üìä Model Performance

| Metric    | Value  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Precision | 97.7%  |
| Recall    | 98.45% |
| F1 Score  | 97%    |
| mAP\@0.5  | 90%    |

YOLOv8 significantly outperformed previous architectures such as YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 Tiny.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work

### Limitations:

* Model depends on large, annotated datasets.
* Integration with real hospital systems requires additional work and compliance.

### Future Enhancements:

* Expand dataset with more diverse samples.
* Improve GUI into a full-fledged application.
* Comply with regulatory and ethical standards for deployment in clinical settings.
